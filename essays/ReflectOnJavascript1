## The start of my journey with JavaScript

These past two weeks of my life have been very hectic. I am beginning my college career at the University of Hawaii at Manoa where I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science
- Data Science. Though I am not sure exactly what path I will take in the vastly expanding field, that is computer science, it all begins this semester (Fall 2022).

I am taking two computer science classes this semester, one of which is ICS 314 Software Engineering I. I am very interested in what this class has in store, from the 
projects to the material in general. This first week we covered the basics of JavaScript, a language in which we will be using throughout the semester. I have no 
experience with JavaScript but I have heard of it before. I even have a book titled “JavaScript & jQuery” that I found at the local BookOff for $9.50. My first bit of 
exposure to JavaScript was through the freeCodeCamp.org JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures modules. The modules were very simple and easy to process and 
understand. I found the first half of the modules pretty easy for the most part, just going over basic syntax. On the left side of the screen the modules give examples 
of what you are expected to perform on the right side which makes it easy to reference the material if you hit a roadblock. As I made my way through the second half of 
the modules I began to slow down. Now, this wasn’t necessarily because JavaScript is difficult or confusing in any way. The reason for my decrease in speed was due to 
the fact that this is a language that I had never seen before. I was making little mistakes and forgetting some of what I had previously covered but with repetition and
time I feel like I could become proficient in JavaScript.
